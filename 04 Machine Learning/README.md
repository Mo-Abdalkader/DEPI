# Wine Dataset Clustering

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates clustering on the Wine dataset using the K-Means algorithm. The Wine dataset consists of 178 samples with 13 features representing different chemical properties of wines.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 178 entries with the following columns:

| #   | Column                | Non-Null Count | Dtype  | Description |
| --- | --------------------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 0   | Alcohol               | 178            | float64| The alcohol content in wine |
| 1   | Malic_Acid            | 178            | float64| The amount of malic acid in wine |
| 2   | Ash                   | 178            | float64| The ash content in wine |
| 3   | Ash_Alcanity          | 178            | float64| The alcalinity of ash in wine |
| 4   | Magnesium             | 178            | int64  | The magnesium content in wine |
| 5   | Total_Phenols         | 178            | float64| The total phenols content in wine |
| 6   | Flavanoids            | 178            | float64| The flavanoids content in wine |
| 7   | Nonflavanoid_Phenols  | 178            | float64| The nonflavanoid phenols content in wine |
| 8   | Proanthocyanins       | 178            | float64| The proanthocyanins content in wine |
| 9   | Color_Intensity       | 178            | float64| The color intensity of wine |
| 10  | Hue                   | 178            | float64| The hue of wine |
| 11  | OD280                 | 178            | float64| The OD280/OD315 of diluted wines |
| 12  | Proline               | 178            | int64  | The proline content in wine |

- **Non-Null Count**: All columns have 178 non-null values.
- **Dtype**: There are 11 columns of type `float64` and 2 columns of type `int64`.

## Clustering Model

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository performs K-Means clustering on the Wine dataset. Here is a summary of the steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Standardization**: The features are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: A K-Means model is trained to cluster the data into three clusters.
4. **Label Assignment**: The resulting cluster labels are added to the DataFrame.
5. **Visualization**: Various plots are created to visualize the clustering results.
